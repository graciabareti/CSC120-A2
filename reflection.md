What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I feel like the instructions weren't clear enough on what was being asked and that it was a bit difficult for being the first assignment. For someone taking this course in the future, they definetly would need some additional support possibly within the class time as many students that are taking this course currently didn't get the opportunity to take a lab in addition to their existing CS 111 course like past years did.
